| Your web application experiences traffic spikes during business hours. How would you design an auto-scaling solution?        | Use an **ALB** to distribute traffic across EC2 instances in an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**. Configure **CloudWatch metrics** (CPU, requests/target) with **scaling policies** and **warm-up periods**. This ensures instances scale up before peak and scale down after traffic drops. |
| You need to migrate a 10TB database to AWS with minimal downtime. What approach would you take?                              | Use **AWS DMS** with **Change Data Capture (CDC)** to replicate data continuously. Create a **read replica** in RDS/Aurora, cut over using **blue-green deployment**, and switch traffic using **Route 53 weighted routing** for zero/minimal downtime.                                  |
| Your company requires all data to be encrypted at rest and in transit. How would you implement this across S3, RDS, and EBS? | - **S3:** Enable **SSE-KMS**.<br>- **RDS:** Enable **encryption at creation** and enforce SSL/TLS connections.<br>- **EBS:** Enable **EBS encryption** (default with KMS).<br>- Ensure **KMS CMKs** are rotated. In transit → enforce **HTTPS/SSL**.                                     |
| Design a disaster recovery solution for a critical application with RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour.                        | Use **multi-region deployment** with **cross-region replication** (S3 CRR, RDS read replica). Automate backups with **EBS snapshots & Aurora Global DB**. Use **Route 53 failover** health checks to switch traffic to the secondary region within RTO.                                  |
| You need to provide secure access to AWS resources for a third-party vendor. How would you implement this?                   | Create a **cross-account IAM role** with least-privilege permissions. Require an **external ID** for security. Vendor assumes role via **STS temporary credentials**. No long-term access keys stored.                                                                                   |
| Your application needs to process files uploaded to S3 and store results in DynamoDB. Design the architecture.               | Use **S3 Event Notifications** to trigger a **Lambda function**. Lambda processes the file, writes metadata/results to **DynamoDB**. Configure **DLQ (SQS or SNS)** for error handling.                                                                                                  |
| How would you implement a blue-green deployment for a containerized application?                                             | Use **ECS/EKS** with **two target groups** in an **ALB**. Deploy new version to “green” while “blue” is live. Use **CodeDeploy** with health checks to shift traffic gradually, and rollback on failure.                                                                                 |
| Design a solution to automatically remediate security violations detected by AWS Config.                                     | Configure **AWS Config rules** to detect violations. Use **EventBridge rules** to trigger **Lambda functions or Systems Manager Automation** to remediate (e.g., close ports, encrypt volumes).                                                                                          |
| Your application requires consistent performance and cannot tolerate cold starts. How would you optimize Lambda?             | Use **provisioned concurrency** to keep functions warm. Optimize code with **smaller deployment packages**, enable **connection pooling**, and optionally trigger periodic warm-up invocations.                                                                                          |
| Implement a solution to automatically scale DynamoDB based on traffic patterns.                                              | Enable **DynamoDB Auto Scaling** with **CloudWatch target utilization** (e.g., 70%). For unpredictable workloads, use **On-Demand mode**. Add alarms for throttling metrics.                                                                                                             |
| Design a multi-tier architecture with high availability and fault tolerance.                                                 | Use **VPC** with **public/private subnets** across multiple AZs. **ALB** in front, **ASG of EC2s** in app tier, **RDS Multi-AZ** for DB, and **ElastiCache** for caching. Distribute across AZs for resilience.                                                                          |
| How would you implement centralized logging for a microservices architecture?                                                | Send application logs from ECS/Lambda/EC2 to **CloudWatch Logs**. Use **Log Groups & Streams** per service. Enable **CloudWatch Insights** for queries. Optionally stream to **S3 + Athena/Elasticsearch** for analytics.                                                                |
| Your organization needs to enforce compliance across multiple AWS accounts. Design the governance structure.                 | Use **AWS Organizations + Control Tower** to create a landing zone. Apply **SCPs** for account-level restrictions. Use **AWS Config & Security Hub** for compliance enforcement and visibility.                                                                                          |

Copy snapshots to another region for DR. Use **Lambda automation** for restoring instances from snapshots.                                                                                                    |

| How would you implement API rate limiting and throttling?                                                                    | Use **API Gateway** built-in throttling and usage plans. Add **WAF rate-based rules** for DDoS protection. Apply **Lambda concurrency limits** to prevent backend overload.                                                                                                              |

Add **manual approval steps** before prod deploy. Use **IAM roles** for least privilege. Enable **CloudTrail/CloudWatch** for auditing.                                                                                      |
